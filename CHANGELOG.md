# Changelog

## 0.3.1

Fix pi package skill discovery errors when installing via `pi install npm:glimpseui`.

- **Fix**: Move `SKILL.md` to `skills/glimpse/` so parent directory matches skill name
- **Fix**: Change `pi.skills` path from `"."` to `"./skills"` — prevents CHANGELOG.md and README.md from being picked up as skills

## 0.3.0

Ship as a unified pi package — `npm install glimpseui` works standalone, `pi install npm:glimpseui` installs the companion extension and skill automatically. No separate extension setup needed.

- **Unified package**: Extension and skill bundled in the main npm package via `pi` manifest in `package.json`
- **Removed**: Separate `pi-extension/package.json` — no more nested install step

## 0.2.0

System info API. The `ready` event now includes screen geometry, display info, cursor position, and dark/light mode — everything you need to adapt UI to the user's environment.

- **System info on ready**: `screen`, `appearance` (dark mode, accent color, tint color), `cursor` position, and `screens` array
- **Runtime info**: `get-info` protocol command to re-query system state at any time
- **Node wrapper**: `win.info` getter caches the latest system info

## 0.1.1

Minor polish to the demo window.

- **Demo fix**: Close demo window on Escape, Enter, or button click

## 0.1.0

Initial release. Two source files, zero dependencies — a native macOS WKWebView that speaks JSON Lines.

**Core:**
- Native Swift binary (~420 lines) — single-file compilation with `swiftc`, no Xcode required
- Node.js ESM wrapper (~175 lines) — `EventEmitter` API over stdin/stdout
- Bidirectional JSON Lines protocol: send HTML/JS in, get messages/events out
- Sub-50ms window open time

**Window modes:**
- Standard, frameless, floating, transparent, click-through — combine freely
- Cursor-following with configurable offset
- Keyboard support in all modes including frameless

**API:**
- `open()` — open a window with HTML string or options
- `prompt()` — open a window and await a single response (ideal for dialogs/forms)
- `loadFile()` — load HTML from a file path
- `autoClose` — close window automatically when the first message is received
- `npx glimpseui` CLI with built-in demo

**Post-0.1.0 (unreleased at the time, shipped in 0.2.0+):**

Pi companion extension — a floating status pill that follows your cursor and shows what your pi agents are doing in real time.

- **Companion extension**: `/companion` command toggles a cursor-following overlay
- **Multi-agent support**: Shared window via Unix socket IPC — multiple pi sessions report to one pill
- **Spring physics**: Smooth cursor following with `--follow-mode spring`
- **Cursor anchoring**: Snap window to cursor corners (`top-right`, `bottom-left`, etc.) with safe-zone awareness
- **Live status**: Dot color, activity label (Reading, Editing, Running...), file/command detail, elapsed time, context window usage %
- **Dark/light mode**: Adapts text stroke and colors to system appearance
